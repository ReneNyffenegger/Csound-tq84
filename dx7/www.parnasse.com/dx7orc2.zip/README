Notes:

Algorithms 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 24
and 31 are perfect (I hope so!).

Algorithms 16, 21, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32 should be perfect too,
but I am not sure.

I am not so self-confident for algorithms 09, 11, and especially 20 and 22.

I will be extremely happy if someone could test them with a real DX7
and send me some comments (and compare them with Doug Walter's versions).

A "little" problem with algorithm 06 still remains...
But I hope a Csound-wizard will solve it for me ;-)

Have fun with DX72Csound!
