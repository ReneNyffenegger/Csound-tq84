# Schroeders reverberator

Definition for reverberation time: Time until the sound has decreased to 0.1% of the original amplitude.

The original signal is piped through 4 parallel comb filters then through 2 serial all-pass filters.

Comb delay times are relatively prime to one another (0.031, 0.037, 0.041, 0.043)

The all-pass filters have delays between 0.005 and 0.02 seconds. The make the echo density. The first all-pass turns each comb echo into a series

## Improvements

The signal might be piped through a low pass filter at the end to make it sound less metallic.
