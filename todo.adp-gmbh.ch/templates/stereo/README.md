The parameters p6 and p7 are the coordinates of the tone (in meters). The
positive x axis goes out through the right ear, the positive y axis goes out
through the eyes. The coordinates 0/0 are in the head. 

idistr and idistl are the calculated distance of the tone from the right and left ear respectively.
This leads to the calculation of how much the tone is delayed until it reaches the ears: idelayl and idelayr.
Also, the amplitude ildoudr and ildoudl is dependent on idistn

Unfortunately, the values for idistn are so small that they don't appear to have an influence on the perception of the tone.
